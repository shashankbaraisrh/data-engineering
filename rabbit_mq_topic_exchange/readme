"Hello World" with RabbitMQ

Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic "Hello World" example using RabbitMQ, a robust and widely-used message broker. RabbitMQ facilitates communication between applications through the exchange of messages, based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

Implementation Overview
Sender Script
The sender script uses the pika library to interact with RabbitMQ. It:

Establishes a connection to RabbitMQ on localhost.
Declares a queue named data_pipeline.
Sends a "Hello World!" message to this queue.
Closes the connection.
Receiver Script
The receiver script, also using the pika library, performs the following:

Establishes a connection to RabbitMQ on localhost.
Declares the data_pipeline queue.
Defines a callback function to print received messages.
Sets up a consumer for the data_pipeline queue and starts consuming messages.
Handles graceful shutdown on interruption.

Evaluation Criteria
Functionality: Demonstrates core RabbitMQ functionality through message sending and receiving.
Clarity and Conciseness: A video demonstration provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the setup and implementation.
Completeness and Clarity: The architectural report comprehensively documents each step.
Creativity and Problem-Solving: Showcases key problem-solving skills required for configuring and utilizing RabbitMQ.

Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrates the basic usage of RabbitMQ through a "Hello World" example, providing a solid foundation for exploring more advanced messaging patterns.
